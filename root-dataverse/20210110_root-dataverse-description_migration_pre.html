    <h2>Planned Dataverse Migration:</h2>
    <h3>Outage from 14 January 2021, 10pm, to max. 15 January 2021, 10pm</h3>
    <p>We're migrating Dataverse and it's data to another location. During the migration you mostly won't be able to directly access our service at data.aussda.at and download our research data. Actions taken during the period could be lost (e. g. request access, change user settings). We apologize for any inconvenience caused by the outage. You can find more information on the process on our <a href="https://twitter.com/TheAUSSDA" title="@theAUSSDA">Twitter</a>, our <a href="https://aussda.at/maintenance/">Maintenance page</a> or by writing us an email at <a href="mailto:info@aussda.at?subject=data.aussda.at Migration">info@aussda.at</a>.</p>
